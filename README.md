Comet needs the following installed:
- MariaDB 10 (latest) we are still looking into upgrading it to MariaDB 11
- A debugger (intellij, Visualstudio with java/maven support, or any other java debugger)
- A CMS that is compatible with Comet, Atom CMS can be made compatible with a few changes : https://discord.gg/NTM85w4H &lArr; Atom Discord
- Coerce needs to be installed within Intelij : https://git.krews.org/duckietm/coerce
- You need to bring your own Catalog, you can import the catalogs from Arcturus Emulator

And don't forget caring is sharing, so any help on the development is highly appreciated, and yes everybody that contributes will get in the thanks list !
